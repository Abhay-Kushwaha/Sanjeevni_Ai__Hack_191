# 🧠 Sanjeevni AI, AI-Powered Health Prediction & Consultation Platform
An all-in-one AI-powered web platform that helps patients **predict diseases**, **receive tailored medical advice**, **book medicines**, and **consult doctors**—all from the comfort of their home.

## 🩺 Problem Statement
Patients often need to jump across multiple platforms for:
- Identifying their health issues
- Consulting a doctor
- Buying prescribed medicines

This process is time-consuming, inconvenient, and overwhelming, especially for people with urgent or chronic health issues.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
We developed a centralized AI-powered healthcare platform that streamlines the entire journey:

> Predict ➝ Advise ➝ Consult ➝ Cure ➝ Deliver

- Symptom-based and MRI-based disease prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Detailed medical advice (precautions, medication, diet)
- Direct consultation with certified doctors via video calls
- Auto-booking and delivery of prescribed medicines
