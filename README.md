    # 🧠 Sanjeevni AI, AI-Powered Health Prediction & Consultation Platform

    An all-in-one AI-powered web platform that helps patients **predict diseases**, **receive tailored medical advice**, **book medicines**, and **consult doctors**—all from the comfort of their home.

    ---

    ## 🩺 Problem Statement

    Patients often need to jump across multiple platforms for:
    - Identifying their health issues
    - Consulting a doctor
    - Buying prescribed medicines

    This process is time-consuming, inconvenient, and overwhelming, especially for people with urgent or chronic health issues.

    ---

    ## 💡 Proposed Solution

    We developed a centralized AI-powered healthcare platform that streamlines the entire journey:

    > Predict ➝ Advise ➝ Consult ➝ Cure ➝ Deliver

    - Symptom-based and MRI-based disease prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
    - Detailed medical advice (precautions, medication, diet)
    - Direct consultation with certified doctors via video calls
    - Auto-booking and delivery of prescribed medicines
